                <p>Charity is a desire of the heart to help others in distress and to think 
                    good of others. It is one kind of human quality. It makes our heart bountiful.
                     It is an expression of love for human beings and the creation of Allah. 
                     Charity comes to mitigate the sufferings of humanities. It aims at improving 
                     the condition of the poor. This quality brings happiness on earth, strengthens
                      the ties of relationships among men, removes enmity, and creates fellow-feeling.
                       Even a small gift can remove the sorrow of the distressed. All religions of 
                       the world encourage it.</p>
